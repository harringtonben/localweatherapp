# Local Weather App

> This app will do the following: 

* When you place a zip code in the search bar and either click enter or the submit button it will display the current weather for that zip code and will give you options to toggle between:
    * Current Weather
    * 3 Day Forecast
    * 7 Day Forecast
* If you do not input in a 5 digit zip code, it will not allow you to submit your answer
